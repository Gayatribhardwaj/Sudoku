# Sudoku
This Java program solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. It checks each empty cell and fills it with a valid digit (1â€“9) while following Sudoku rules: no duplicate numbers in any row, column, or 3x3 grid. If a solution exists, it prints the completed puzzle; otherwise, it notifies that no solution exists.
